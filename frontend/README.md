# Notelux

Notelux is a web application for writing, organizing and sharing notes, built with React.

The project originally used Firestore for data storage but has since transitioned to using a PostgreSQL database hosted on Railway. The version with the Firestore implementation is preserved on the [`legacy/firestore-database`](https://github.com/anna-rudas/notelux/tree/legacy/firestore-database) branch.
